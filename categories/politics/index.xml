      <description>When I was a kid, I had one big fear. Most kids were scared of heights, or the dark, or the monster under the bed. I was scared of being pulled over. I was scared that the cops were going to take away my mom and dad.
I&amp;rsquo;m a child of immigrants. I wont go into it too much, but I&amp;rsquo;ll just say both my parents are citizens now. They weren&amp;rsquo;t then.</description>
