      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the 2010s and I really want to reflect on my life. But I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m in a flux part of my life and with so much happening around me, I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be easier to just do games of the decade.

      <description>I want to love Elder Scrolls: Blades. I do. I really really do.
--  Title Screen - I wish it lived up to the hype of seeing this page 
I&amp;rsquo;m starting this off by saying that I am a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls series. I have put more hours than I can count into Oblivion and almost as many into Skyrim. Elder Scrolls Online is in my top 5 MMOs.</description>
