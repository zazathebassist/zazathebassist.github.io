      <description>Now, I started writing this before Oko was banned but even after the Ban, I feel like I have something to say.
So I was a very into Magic a few years ago. I came into the game at the end of the Return to Ravnica block, my first event and one of the first times playing was an event called a &amp;ldquo;Magic Celebration&amp;rdquo; in 2013 where they handed out free decks and packs.</description>

      <description>I left Magic about two years ago. It was a slow fade, and once I was done I thought I was out. I thought I quit this Cardboard Crack
OH NO
You don&amp;rsquo;t just leave Magic.
And I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I&amp;rsquo;m back.
Backstory. I stopped playing Magic about two years ago mostly due to money and time. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t justify the entry fee, or the time commitment every Friday. So I stopped going.</description>
