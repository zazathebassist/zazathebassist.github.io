        <p>i have at multiple times tried to get into film photography. but every time, getting the photos to the lab is where the hobby died.</p>
<p>now the lab is a single bus away. im fucked and so is my wallet.</p>
<h2 id="gear">gear<a href="#gear" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>fully taking this idea from a <a href="https://photography.ultraviolet.gay/visible.html">friend</a> to use this as a list of camera stuff i have</p>
<ul>
<li>Olympus XA - 35mm <em>f</em>/2.8 this little camera looks like an ugly 80s toy but takes some incredible pictures. the lens is way sharper than it has any right being.</li>
<li>Minolta x-370 - minolta gang. nuff said.</li>
<li>Minolta MD Rokkor-x 45mm <em>f</em>/2 - everyone needs a sharp nifty fifty</li>
<li>Vivitar M/MD mount 70-210mm <em>f</em>/4.5-5.6</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="film">film<a href="#film" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>i&rsquo;m still experimenting with film stock. this is mostly gonna be a consise review of the films ive shot. i&rsquo;ll eventually write more about these films but just take this as one girls perspective in the perpetually rainy pacific northwest</p>
<ul>
<li>Ilford HP5 - it&rsquo;s hp5. you either shoot it almost exclusively or you hate it. its black and white. it has nice grain. it feels like film. it looks like film. this is what film should be.</li>
<li>Fuji Superia 400 - a film that honestly does not get enough love. yes its a drug store film. it looks like 90s family photos. thats a <em>good</em> thing. put it in front of a sharp lens and push it a stop and this might honestly be my favorite color film. it looks like what memories should look like</li>
<li>Cinestill 800t - yes, its a meme photo. yes, it takes incredible shots of neon. yes i have shot Dicks (the burger joint) with every roll of Cinestill that i&rsquo;ve bought. doesnt matter. this film does the thing. it has a narrow band of what it&rsquo;s good at. but if you&rsquo;re shooting past golden hour, in the rain, neon, or gas stations, this is your guy</li>
<li>Kodak Gold 200 - its color film. its fine. it&rsquo;s fun, even. it looks like what color film should. but i guess it doesnt really do anything to stand out like fuji superia 400.</li>
</ul>
<p>more film coming. i have a roll of arista 400 and cinestill 400d in the fridge</p>
<h2 id="darkroom">darkroom<a href="#darkroom" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been bitten by the &ldquo;you dont spend enough money on this hobby, here&rsquo;s a tangential hobby&rdquo; bug. now i wanna make my own darkroom.</p>
<p>for now im slowly collecting what i need to start developing with caffenol. for your own sanity, dont look it up.</p>
