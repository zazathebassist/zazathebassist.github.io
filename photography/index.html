        <p>i have at multiple times tried to get into film photography. but every time, getting the photos to the lab is where the hobby died. now i&rsquo;ve set up a ridiculous developing and scanning setup in my apartment (blog post eventually) and film photography has finally stuck.</p>
<p>honestly, it also helps to have a small community of photographers around me that i can share my work with and who i can grow with. that definitely helps me keep shooting.</p>

<h2 id="gear">gear<a href="#gear" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>fully taking this idea from a <a href="https://photography.ultraviolet.gay/visible.html">good friend</a> to use this as a list of camera stuff i have</p>
<h4 id="cameras">cameras<a href="#cameras" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<ul>
<li>Olympus XA - 35mm <em>f</em>/2.8 this little camera looks like an ugly 80s toy but takes some incredible pictures. the lens is way sharper than it has any right being.</li>
<li>Minolta x-370 - honestly everything that i could want out of an SLR. it&rsquo;s brilliant, its works with my brain, and i&rsquo;ve gotten some absolutely incredible shots with it.</li>
<li>Kodak Junior Six-20 - a medium format film camera from the <em>1930s</em>. this camera takes the now discontinued 620 film format, which is essentially 120 but made proprietary. (full blog post soon)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="lenses">lenses<a href="#lenses" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<ul>
<li>Minolta MD Rokkor-x 45mm <em>f</em>/2 - everyone needs a sharp nifty fifty</li>
<li>Vivitar M/MD mount 70-210mm <em>f</em>/4.5-5.6</li>
<li>Minolta MC Macro <em>f</em>/3.5 50mm</li>
</ul>

<p>i&rsquo;m still experimenting with film stock. turns out there&rsquo;s a LOT of different films out there, even after they got discontinued. i mostly shoot Ilford HP5 in black and white. i did mostly shoot Fuji Superia 400 for color, but sourcing that has gotten a bit weird so i <em>think</em> my default color might move to either Kodak Gold 200 or Ultramax 400. tbd. most of my shooting is in the beautiful but forever rainy Pacific Northwest. so ya know, that does influence me a lot.</p>
<p>(film comparison page coming eventually)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="darkroomscanning">darkroom/scanning<a href="#darkroomscanning" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been bitten by the &ldquo;you dont spend enough money on this hobby, here&rsquo;s a tangential hobby&rdquo; bug. now i wanna make my own darkroom.</p>
<p>all black and white film i develop using a process called Stand Developing, using a ridiculous chemical called Rodinal which was invented in the late 1800s. color film is developed either by Panda Lab in Queen Anne or by Taco Bell Labs in Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>before i get the whole crazy setup, i do have a scanning setup. i will eventually write about it when it reaches and end state. it is a homemade dslr scanning setup. i made my own copy stand, i&rsquo;m using a cheap amazon light table and a little lomography film holder, and a camera mount. im essentially taking digital pictures of the analogue film, and scanning them, so i can post on insta and on my blog.</p>
<p>because what good is taking a bunch of photos if no one else will ever see them.</p>
