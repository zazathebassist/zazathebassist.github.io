            It&rsquo;s that time of year again. Yearly Theme time. And I want to coast off the success of last year&rsquo;s theme. Last year I set myself on the path of the Year of Discovery. And through that, I explored more of California and of myself then I have in a long time. I am content that I marked a good path that will allow me to keep moving forward and explore myself and the world around me more.

            I did not expect 2021 to be a whole second year of Covid. When I chose my yearly theme, the Vaccine had been completed and it looked like full vaccinations would happen by the end of Spring. How could I have foreseen Covid being so political that almost a year after after the vaccine started being given, we would be at 61% of the country vaccinated, and have experienced two variants and three whole waves requiring the wold to continue shutting down.

            This was first written in May 2021 but due to a mental block I didn&rsquo;t get it uploaded until September 2021
Music has been a massive part of my life for about as long as I remember. Just now, a friend was asking her friends about their favorite songs. That sent me down a spiral about what my favorite music is. Before, I held the position that it was impossible for me to hold a &ldquo;favorite song&rdquo; but now, that&rsquo;s changed.

            So, 2020 sucked. I have been doing yearly themes since I believe 2015 and 2020 is the only year where I completely lost track of my theme. I don&rsquo;t think I need to go into why covid but it&rsquo;s time to get back on the train.
So for 2021, I am doing a 180 from the life I led in 2020. Last year might as well have been &ldquo;the Year of Lockdown&rdquo;.

            Photography is an expensive hobby. It&rsquo;s one I love but definitely will suck as much money as you put into it. So when I see a lens that costs $35 on Amazon, I know I need to get it immediately.
Taken with iPhone 11
Fotasy 35mm f/1.6 Micro 4/3 Lens The lens I picked up is the Fotasy 35mm f/1.6 lens. It&rsquo;s Micro 4/3 lens so it&rsquo;s a 70mm equivalent. That&rsquo;s a bit tight for pure street photography but I should be able to make it work.

            editors note: lol. lmao. this is cute past emma. where you&rsquo;re going, you dont need pixels.
I was very into photography a few years ago. Decent DSLR, lenses, accessories, the whole deal. But for various reasons my love of photography left me. The camera was too heavy to bring, I wasn&rsquo;t good enough, and I had some personal reasons. So I kinda stopped photography. The DSLR was sold off. My film camera is in a box somewhere.
