    <section class="article-content">
    <p>I did not expect 2021 to be a whole second year of Covid. When I chose my yearly theme, the Vaccine had been completed and it looked like full vaccinations would happen by the end of Spring. How could I have foreseen Covid being so political that almost a year after after the vaccine started being given, we would be at 61% of the country vaccinated, and have experienced two variants and three whole waves requiring the wold to continue shutting down.</p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t a retrospective on a year of Covid, it&rsquo;s a retrospective on my year. When I started this year, I told myself I would make it my Year of Discovery. I spent too much of 2020 stagnating. I knew there was a chance for Covid to not disappear and my Year of Discovery was <em>not</em> predicated on Covid disappearing. I am generally happy with how I did and I&rsquo;m glad at the clarity that Year of Discovery provided me. I even reconnected with some friends in a way that has done nothing but made my life better.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>Music is probably the place I progressed the least. I did play guitar and bass more than I did in 2020, but that wasn&rsquo;t by much. However, I will take any progress I can. I started a pedal collection and started playing around with creating soundscapes and I discovered a new love for the creation of music. I have set myself up to create more music as time goes on and I have slowly started repairing my relationship with music. My band situation is uh <em>complicated</em> but I have faith things will work out.</p>
<h2 id="exploration">Exploration</h2>
<p>I have taken 2021 to explore so much of what I wanted. I didn&rsquo;t do nearly as much as I wanted to, but that&rsquo;s life isn&rsquo;t it. I picked up an annual pass for both the Natural History Museum and Universal Studios. I know they&rsquo;re not remotely similar but both show me expanding. I did get my Amateur Radio License. I&rsquo;ve done other small things over the year (gotten an Xbox and played more games, went out to different places, went to concerts again) but all of them kinda show the same thing. Me exploring and growing. The wildest discovery is that I&rsquo;m slowly becoming a car girl. Pls send help lol. No but seriously I got super into F1, and then Forza, and now I wanna get a beater car and do Rallycross. Send help.</p>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<p>This is probably the most surprising thing to come from this year. I started this year with a messy breakup and a lot of introspection needed onto what I wanted and needed in a relationship. I fully expected 2021 to be a year I spent single and used that to grow. I guess mid year me had other plans because I am now in a relationship with a wonderful person. But more than that, this person has taught me so much of what a good relationship should look like. How communication should work. How to approach difficult situations. What I deserve in a relationship and what I should give. And I think the most important thing is I&rsquo;ve discovered how to keep being my own person and have my own time separate from the relationship. And that is something I had struggled tremendously on. And that is something I am incredibly grateful for.</p>
<h2 id="gender">Gender</h2>
<p>Okay. This is a hard section to write. Not necessarily because I am still confused (tho I still am). More because I will be putting something out to the internet. This year I approached something that I had had in my periphery for a while but, I don&rsquo;t know if I was just too scared or not ready for the answer. But after this year, there&rsquo;s no way to deny it. I am Trans. What exactly that means I am not sure. I currently feel comfortable calling myself non-binary but I am still going through a lot of emotions. I just know that I am not cis. It helps clear up so much of why I have felt how I have for the last 26 years of my life. I think the hardest part of this year is not that I discovered that I&rsquo;m trans. It&rsquo;s that this is just the start of a journey that will take years. A journey that will never end. But I am looking forward to it, because it is a journey that will lead to a peace of mind that I have so desperately been looking for.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-Up</h2>
<p>So where does this leave me. Oddly, both with a sense of accomplishment, but also a feeling that my journey has just started. Which, at 27 years old, is a feeling I&rsquo;m starting to get tired of. I&rsquo;ve discovered things about myself, and also discovered new paths for me to go down. Some of them will be dead ends, but some will lead me to becoming the best version of me that I can be. And overall, I&rsquo;m happy at that. I genuinely believe this to be my most successful theme. And I hope I can keep this energy and momentum into 2022. Because I need it.</p>
<hr>
<p>The concept of yearly themes comes from the podcast <a class="link" href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/79"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Cortex</a> with CGP Grey and Myke Hurley. They have genuinely helped me think of my life in a way better way. You can also check them out a video that Grey made about yearly themes here <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
