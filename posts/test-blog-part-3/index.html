<p>I ask myself that all too much. This is the 3rd blog I try(4th if you count tumblr&hellip; I don&rsquo;t) in earnest to start. And it&rsquo;s been up in some capacity since September, without updates, so even before I get it in a decent state I already feel like I failed(I talk more about my view on failure Here). But here I am. Starting fresh with a new blog in a new place.</p>
<p>I guess I should maybe start with what this blog is and why I&rsquo;m doing it. The blog itself is a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> blog run off <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> The theme is <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal Mistakes</a>. I switched to that from <a href="https://github.com/iwiedenm/jekyll-theme-massively-src">Massively</a> because I wanted more customization and dark themes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve previously made blogs using Wordpress, both the actual <a href="https://wordpress.com">blog hosting platform</a> and the <a href="https://wordpress.org">self hosted service</a>. And every time there was just some reason I couldn&rsquo;t continue. Wordpress.com was just too restrictive and needed you to pay for <em>everything</em>, whereas the self hosted one was 100% my fault cause I hosted it from my own place&hellip; and DNS isn&rsquo;t fun. I&rsquo;ll just leave that there. Both solutions are great, but not for me.</p>
<p><em><strong>So here I am.</strong></em> On a new service in a new place. I&rsquo;ve already run into a new set of challenges. Jekyll is statically generated off of local files, so any changes to the site need to be made from a computer that has these files. And while I can share them all through GitHub, it still severely restricts where I can make changes to my site. Also, Ruby is&hellip; picky. I am actually writing this post from my grandparents&rsquo; house in Mexico, with no internet connection. I attempt to run the Jekyll build function, but it says I&rsquo;m missing a file that&rsquo;s on the PC, and the self fix tool needs internet access. So I&rsquo;m completely blind to what this post will even look like when done.</p>
<p><code>Could not find ffi-1.9.18 in any of the sources</code> This error message will haunt my dreams.</p>
<p>So&hellip; I&rsquo;ve talked about what I&rsquo;m doing, and the challenges I&rsquo;ve faced. But <em>why</em>? <strong>Why</strong> am I putting myself through this? Is it masochism? Is it some weird social experiment? Honestly&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know. I just know I need an outlet. I have an overactive mind. I suffer from what my friend lovingly called <em>creative blue balls</em>. In my day job, in my life, in my band, there&rsquo;s not many outlets for me to let go and publish what&rsquo;s going on in my head. I need a dumping ground that isn&rsquo;t my notes app(shoutout to <a href="https://bear.app">Bear</a>). I need something public, even if no one will read it, to host my ideas. I need a sort of public journal to come back to.</p>
<p>I also essentially need a portfolio. I am doing what I can to shape my life and make it so I can make my way into freelancing, and I need a way to show what I&rsquo;m really about. So I guess there&rsquo;s that too.</p>
<p>Stick around I guess. I can guarantee I&rsquo;ll be writing more.</p>
