        <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about my 2019 plan for a while. And after the absolute failure that 2018: Year of Less was, but also the kinda semi success of 2017: Year of Completion, and the success of my 2016: Year of Me, I was excited to talk about my new theme. Also New Years Resolutions are dumb.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I started this blog is to chronicle my yearly themes. I&rsquo;ll probably repost my old themes <del>but no promises</del>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about a more realistic yearly theme for a while. And thinking about what I want to do in my life going forward. And I realized no matter what, I want to be producing something. I want to be making some kind of content. Be it podcasts, videos, watercolors, making pens, or just keeping this blog up. I&rsquo;m happiest when I&rsquo;m making something. It&rsquo;s just a really nice feeling making something appear out of nothing. And so, for 2019, I&rsquo;m focusing on content.</p>
<p>In 2018 I&rsquo;ve done a few things sporadically. I made a Youtube review video(might have been late 2017 but I think it was this year), started podcasts/podcast editing, and got a bit back into painting. But it was so disjointed, and I kept just&hellip; doing other things when I had small amounts of time. But making sure I keep myself accountable to this is a big part of the year&rsquo;s Theme.</p>
<p>For people who may not know, yearly themes is a topic that kind of came to be, or was at least first brought to my attention, by the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/79">Cortex</a> podcast. Myke and Grey have been doing yearly themes for a few years. And the whole idea is that you don&rsquo;t have a set goal, because goals fail. You set a theme to help guide decisions. It just helps guide your ideas and thought process, and keeps the theme an active part of your mind that you can focus on, instead of wishful thinking.</p>
<p>And I need that because it is really easy for me to lose focus. The last few months of my life I&rsquo;ve mostly lost direction and kinda been meandering through work and responsibilities and I needed better focus on my life going forward.</p>
