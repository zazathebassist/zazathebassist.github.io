        <p>Photography is an expensive hobby. It&rsquo;s one I love but definitely will suck as much money as you put into it. So when I see a lens that costs $35 on Amazon, I know I need to get it immediately.</p>
<p><img src="fotasy-lens.jpg" alt="Fotasy Lens">
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Taken with iPhone 11<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="fotasy-35mm-f16-micro-43-lens">Fotasy 35mm <em>f</em>/1.6 Micro 4/3 Lens<a href="#fotasy-35mm-f16-micro-43-lens" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The lens I picked up is the Fotasy 35mm <em>f</em>/1.6 lens. It&rsquo;s Micro 4/3 lens so it&rsquo;s a 70mm equivalent. That&rsquo;s a bit tight for pure street photography but I should be able to make it work. And it should be great for portraits. &ldquo;Should&rdquo;. More on that in a bit.</p>
<p>The lens itself feels solid. It is made of metal, which I definitely didn&rsquo;t expect for a lens that cost $35. The lens felt pretty damn sharp on my camera&rsquo;s screen, but when I reviewed the images I got a different story. It&rsquo;s definitely a lot sharper than you&rsquo;d expect out of a $35 lens. It&rsquo;s not a Holga, but it is a far cry from more expensive lenses. I was expecting something like a toy camera lens but this is almost useable.</p>
<p><img src="bokeh.jpeg" alt="BOKEH">
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->This lens does have some killer Bokeh<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The interesting thing about the lens is that the aperture is stepless. There&rsquo;s no clicks at any <em>f</em>-stop,m. There&rsquo;s definitely a freedom to this. If I want to open the aperture <em>slightly</em> more than <em>f</em>/8 without going all the way to <em>f</em>/5.6, I easily can. It makes you think a lot more about your shots. I believe this kind of aperture is more common on video lenses. However, the softness of the lens doesn&rsquo;t seem to lend itself to video.</p>
<p>There are trade-offs of course. The lens is fully manual. There&rsquo;s no electronics in it whatsoever. There is no autofocus. If you&rsquo;re trying to shoot sports, animals, or children this is not the lens for you. But if you&rsquo;re able to take a second to frame and focus your shot this lens might be what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p><img src="bike.jpeg" alt="Bike">
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->It took me a while to get used to a 70mm equivalent lens. Can you tell I normally shoot wide?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>However, it is still a $35 lens. Mine came with what could be a design choice or a defect. Most likely defect. The focus ring turns about an 1/8 of a turn past infinity. So if you&rsquo;re shooting from the hip that might lead to lost shots. I <em>cannot trust</em> this lens to zone focus. I don&rsquo;t know if this is an issue with my lens specifically or with this lens in general but it is something to talk about. There&rsquo;s also slight resistance and grating in the focus ring around infinity. Not major, but something you feel.</p>
<h2 id="image-quality-and-experience">Image Quality and Experience<a href="#image-quality-and-experience" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I ended up rewriting this whole section once I viewed my images on my computer. On my cameras tiny screen, the pictures looked sharp and in focus and I thought I was getting great shots.</p>
<p>The image quality on this lens is <em>not</em> great. It has a very soft feel, even when focused at <em>f</em>/16. The image quality reminds me of a mediocre film point and shoot. And that I might not be a bad thing if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for. The lens has some pretty bad vignetting, and in some images it actually ruins the shot. I could see taking shots with this, running it through some VSCO filters and getting a really nice film feel. But this should not be your main lens.</p>
<p><img src="missed-shot.jpeg" alt="Missed Shot">
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I focused to infinity for this shot. But since the lens is defective and goes past infinity, the shot was missed. This isn&rsquo;t the only shot I missed, and I&rsquo;m not proud of it, but something anyone considering this lens should think about.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>What I did like about this lens is how tiny it is. Like, it&rsquo;s small. It&rsquo;s not quite a pancake lens but it&rsquo;s almost there. It&rsquo;s about 3/4 the size of the kit lens when the kit lens is closed, and less than 1/2 the size of the fully extended kit lens. And for me, that&rsquo;s a completely new experience. The majority of my experience with cameras comes from a Nikon d3300 and its lenses. And I can&rsquo;t help but think of the tele on that and comparing it to this tiny thing.</p>
<p>As for the focal length, I am shooting on Micro 4/3, which means this 35mm lens acts more like a 70mm. This is a change for me because I normally like shooting a lot wider. My last post was literally gushing over the iPhone 11&rsquo;s 13mm equivalent lens. So it was a full 180 for me. But it gives me another perspective.</p>
<p><img src="portrait.jpeg" alt="Portrait">
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Probably my favorite shot with this lens. However, this lens is too soft to take real portraits with.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The lens ends up acting a bit like a portrait lens on my camera. And that kind of makes the softness of the lens hurt a bit more. 70mm is such a good portrait lens and the way subjects look is honestly incredible, but I won&rsquo;t really be able to use it for that if my subjects won&rsquo;t come out sharp.</p>
<h2 id="using-a-10-year-old-mirrorless">Using a 10 Year Old Mirrorless<a href="#using-a-10-year-old-mirrorless" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>So this has been the most surprising part of the whole experience to be quite honest. I&rsquo;m using an Olympus PEN E-PL1. This is a camera that came out 10 years ago in 2010. In the world of digital, to use even a year old camera isn&rsquo;t seen well, let alone a camera from the previous decade.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s been great. The camera accepted the lens immediately and I was able to shoot right after mounting it. This was actually a big concern for me since I saw so many reviews about needing to dig through settings to allow cameras to accept a fully manual lens. But no, it worked right away.</p>
<p><img src="pipes.jpeg" alt="Pipes">
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->My camera metered the light perfectly every time. I just wish this lens didn&rsquo;t suck. You don&rsquo;t see sharpness at any point of this shot.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Of course autofocus and camera controlled aperture don&rsquo;t work. It <em>is</em> a manual lens. But with the camera on P, it does a pretty phenomenal job of metering the light and choosing the right ISO and shutter speed for the shot. In terms of light metering, I haven&rsquo;t had a miss.</p>
<p>There are definitely features I wish I had. The E-PL1 has no focus peaking. So focus has to either be intuition or zooming in with the screen on the back. And I&rsquo;ve definitely missed shots like that. But that&rsquo;s part of the fun of a manual lens. If I wanted shots to be perfectly focused every time I&rsquo;d just use my kit lens at <em>f</em>16.</p>
<p>And of course a 12MP 10 year old sensor isn&rsquo;t exactly cutting edge right now. The ISO is useable only down to about 800. ISO 1600 is pushing it and ISO 3200 is a noisy mess. This is especially challenging to work with on a lens that&rsquo;s already pretty soft.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t been able to put this lens down. And I think that&rsquo;s the most important thing. Since I got this lens it&rsquo;s just lived on my camera. It&rsquo;s fun, it&rsquo;s interesting, it&rsquo;s kinda odd and unique and finicky and sometimes bad. Often bad. It&rsquo;s imperfect. In my first draft of this article I praised that imperfection. After seeing my shots I think that praise was a bit early.</p>
<p><img src="kiah.jpeg" alt="Kiah">
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had to include a picture of dog.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But I wanted a lens that helped me shoot more. I could have saved for months and spent $1000 on a wonderful prime. But $35 and two days of shipping and I&rsquo;m shooting now.</p>
<p>But, buy a $35 lens, expect $35 lens quality.</p>
