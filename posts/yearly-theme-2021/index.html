        <p>So, 2020 sucked. I have been doing yearly themes since I believe 2015 and 2020 is the only year where I completely lost track of my theme. I don&rsquo;t think I need to go into why <del>covid</del> but it&rsquo;s time to get back on the train.</p>
<p>So for 2021, I am doing a 180 from the life I led in 2020. Last year might as well have been &ldquo;the Year of Lockdown&rdquo;. So to get back out there and open my horizons, I am making 2021 my &ldquo;Year of Discovery&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What do I mean by Discovery. There&rsquo;s so much to this world that you can&rsquo;t experience inside the same 4 walls. And there&rsquo;s so much you can do inside those 4 walls that isn&rsquo;t just binging Netflix and doomscrolling Twitter. So I am going to focus on expanding my horizons and taking advantage of what the world has to offer.</p>
<p>In the start of the year, this is gonna be a re-focus on my hobbies. I&rsquo;ve set up my guitar and bass rig for the first time since Covid shut my band down. I&rsquo;m exploring new ways to play either instrument that I hadn&rsquo;t done before. On guitar, I&rsquo;m learning how to play math rock style tapping guitar. And on bass, my band is going down to A so I&rsquo;m learning how to play in A standard. Both are providing me with a new challenge and allowing me to explore a new way of playing music that I never have before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also getting my amateur radio license. Learning Ham radio is something I have been wanting to do since High School and I realized if I keep pushing it off I&rsquo;ll never get it done. So I picked up a Baofeng radio and have a test scheduled soon to get my Ham license.</p>
<p>Besides that, I&rsquo;m just not letting the pandemic keep me locked up anymore. I&rsquo;ve started going out hiking. I&rsquo;m planning on meeting up with my band soon to actually play music.</p>
<p>All in all, I miss life. And my yearly theme is just a way for me to start living again.</p>
<hr>
<p>The concept of yearly themes comes from the podcast <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/79">Cortex</a> with CGP Grey and Myke Hurley. You can also check them out a video that Grey made about yearly themes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE">here</a></p>
