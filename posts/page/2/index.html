            Now, I started writing this before Oko was banned but even after the Ban, I feel like I have something to say.
So I was a very into Magic a few years ago. I came into the game at the end of the Return to Ravnica block, my first event and one of the first times playing was an event called a &ldquo;Magic Celebration&rdquo; in 2013 where they handed out free decks and packs.

            I&rsquo;ve been thinking about my 2019 plan for a while. And after the absolute failure that 2018: Year of Less was, but also the kinda semi success of 2017: Year of Completion, and the success of my 2016: Year of Me, I was excited to talk about my new theme. Also New Years Resolutions are dumb.
Part of the reason I started this blog is to chronicle my yearly themes. I&rsquo;ll probably repost my old themes but no promises.

            It&rsquo;s been an odd month or two for me. For the first time in as long as I can remember, I&rsquo;ve been mostly disconnected from the internet.
This wasn&rsquo;t really any kind of planned event. I had recently become more active on the Do By Friday discord, was fairly active with my bands social media, rediscovered Twitter a third time, and was actually enjoying Instagram. Then, shortly before I took my trip to Mexico, my use basically plummited.

            editors note: two things have changed in this time. i&rsquo;ve quit and come back to magic two more times. and a mac client for Magic Arena has been released. ^.^
I left Magic about two years ago. It was a slow fade, and once I was done I thought I was out. I thought I quit this Cardboard Crack
OH NO
You don&rsquo;t just leave Magic.
And I&rsquo;m so glad I&rsquo;m back.

            When I was a kid, I had one big fear. Most kids were scared of heights, or the dark, or the monster under the bed. I was scared of being pulled over. I was scared that the cops were going to take away my mom and dad.
I&rsquo;m a child of immigrants. I wont go into it too much, but I&rsquo;ll just say both my parents are citizens now. They weren&rsquo;t then.

            i&rsquo;m on blog #5 now. im also a different gender from when i wrote this. it&rsquo;s here as an archive, mostly for nostalgia at this point. at the insufferably up-tight loser i was i guess. everything below here is past me
I ask myself that all too much. This is the 3rd blog I try(4th if you count tumblr&hellip; I don&rsquo;t) in earnest to start. And it&rsquo;s been up in some capacity since September, without updates, so even before I get it in a decent state I already feel like I failed(I talk more about my view on failure Here).
