  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again. Yearly Theme time. And I want to coast off the success of last year&rsquo;s theme. Last year I set myself on the path of the Year of Discovery. And through that, I explored more of California and of myself then I have in a long time. I am content that I marked a good path that will allow me to keep moving forward and explore myself and the world around me more. But I want to do more than just see new things. I want to create. I have this need in me not just to observe the beauty of this world, but to contribute to it.</p>
<p>That is why this year I am setting off on the Year of Creation.</p>
<p>Creativity has been something I have struggled with regularly throughout my life. I have regularly wanted to or tried to pursue creative venues, but either because of some bad executive dysfunction, overly busy schedules, or imposter syndrome I have ended up not following through. My most creative solo venture, my TikTok page, lasted essentially 4 months before I needed to take a break. I&rsquo;m not happy about that.</p>
<p>However, I feel like I have entered a new part of my life. One where I am able to dedicate the time and energy to create in the ways I want to, and I want a theme that will help me pursue this better. But the big thing here is what I mean by &ldquo;creativity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And honestly, I&rsquo;m keeping it pretty open and vague for a reason. I have a lot of creative outlets and would rather just set myself the goal of creating <em>something beautiful</em> instead of trying to lock it down to something more specific like &ldquo;write a song a month&rdquo; or &ldquo;upload a TikTok a week&rdquo;. This is more about building a habit of making things than it is the actual output.</p>
<p>And to add to that, a big part of this is going to be not caring about the quality of my finished product. I am not trying to make an album that will chart or another TikTok that breaks 100k views. I&rsquo;m just trying to be me, and create things that I like.</p>
<p>The creative venues I have available to me are&hellip; too many. But I would like to spend more time creating music and video content. Above all, I always come back to music and video as the two creative venues that fill me with the most joy and offset that difficulty I have in creating stuff. I don&rsquo;t like setting myself goals, but I want to have music published. I have run a semi-successful video channel already, music is the one venue I have not truly been able to just make my own. It has always been tied to other people. And with my band in a <em>difficult spot</em>, this year more than ever will be a good year for this.</p>
<p>So, here I go. This article is part of the Year of Creation. I got two blog posts out in a week. I don&rsquo;t expect to keep this pace, but I wanna keep this energy through the year.</p>

<p>The concept of yearly themes comes from the podcast <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/79">Cortex</a> with CGP Grey and Myke Hurley. They have genuinely helped me think of my life in a way better way. You can also check them out a video that Grey made about yearly themes here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE</a></p>
